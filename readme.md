# sketchy music share

WebRTC-based p2p server to easily stream music from a device to another, all of that uniquely from the web browser. Works on android too. Multiple devices can access available songs on the network and multiple devices can also host songs so a common playlist can be built if you feel like having friends.

Signaling server is in python.

> Basic use case comes from the fact that all my music is stored on my phone and I sometimes want to listen to music while using my laptop.

> Current problem is that you have to go back to the browser tab for the transfert to proceed if your phone went into sleep mode
